# CS3230 NP subproblem

## Clique

Given a graph G=(V,E), a clique of G is a subset $V'\subseteq V$  such that $\forall v,u \in V: uv\in E $. i.e. G'= (V', E) is a complete graph. |V'| is the size of a clique 

* Optimization version: given a graph G, find the maximum size of clique of G
* Decisional version: given a graph G and a number k. decides whether there exists clique of G with size k

#### Proof: clique is a NP-complete problem.
